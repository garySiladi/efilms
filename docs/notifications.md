### OperaTV
As the standard JavaScript methods for alert(), prompt() and confirm() are not supported on all platforms that run the Opera TV Store (since they require platform integration), applications that needs modal dialogs (such as data entry prompts or general alerts/messages) need to provide these using HTML/CSS/JavaScript â€“ which also allows for these modal dialogs to be styled in line with the rest of the application.
